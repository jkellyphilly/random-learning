# Regex

Great for debugging and whatnot: https://regexr.com/ 

## Notations

`/re/` --> RegEx goes inside the two slashes

`/re/g` --> `g` here means `global` mode, so look for the RegEx throughout the entire document/string.

Other modes:
- `i` --> case insensitive
- `m` --> multiline. By default, RegEx can **only** span **one** line.
