## Using Bash
### What's bash?
It's a shell ("bourne again shell"), a program that allows us to interact with many things on our computer. Works best on Linux systems, though not required to be on Linux. 

Type `bash` to enter an interactive bash shell. `bash --version` gives the current bash version. 

### Pipes and redirections
Result/output of one command/process gets immediately fed into the next.
